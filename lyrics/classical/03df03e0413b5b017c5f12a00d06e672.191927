Whenever we kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips may be near
But where is your heart

It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
But where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realise
That you've a heart
That never melts
When we kiss
Do you close your eyes
Pretending that I'm someone else

I must break the spell
This cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
Darling where is your heart
