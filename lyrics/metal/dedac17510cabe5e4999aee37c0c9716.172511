I travel over high mountains
through deep valleys and forests
Crossing great rivers
in search of knowledge of the gods
from far beyond place and time
I hear a whispering wind,
it tells me to strive on
through the horizon of my thoughts

I am the mindtraveller
my quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
and the wisdom of the elderly
Gazing into my mind
entering my soul.
Is there not a secret to unfold.
(Here I have advices to be told)

I am the mindtraveller
seeking wisdom of yore
I am the mindexplorer
striving to know so much more
Spirits of history fill my soul
with divine old words
I am on the right track
out of the haze I'll emerge

I reach unknown corners
in the back of my mind
Never been here before
still I recognise it all.
I hear the whispering voices
clearly all around me,
echoing in the valley
where magic intellect dwells

Finally I can see the blind
not knowing why they exists,
I hear laments of nature,
where led the path we missed?
