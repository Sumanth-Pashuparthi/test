Ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...yeah!
It goes a 1, 2, 3...

Yeah'n it's just another bombtrack
And suckas be thinkin that they can fake this
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beat downs cold runna train on punk ho's that
Think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
So recall the downfall
And the businesses that burned us all
See through the news and views that twist reality enough
I call the bluff
Manifest destiny

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

The thoughts of a militant mind
Hardline, Hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch them burn

'''Chorus'''
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn,
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn,
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn,
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn,

It goes a 1, 2, 3...
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
But now dope hooks make punks take another look
my thoughts ya hear, ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
With the thoughts of a militant mind,
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits i ignite
And the watch 'em burn

'''Chorus'''
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn!
