Come on
Ugh

Although ya try to discredit
Ya still never edit
The needle I'll thread it
Radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double I'm mad, still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it could never come close to the rage
Built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy

Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements cease when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police (what?), the judges (what?), the feds (the feds)
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah
Yeah, back in this

With poetry my mind I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lackin' dat finesse
Who I got ta who I got to do to wake you up
To shake you up to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos
Mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove
Then I stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step Then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream
And put it to an end
Ya betta beware
Of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors

Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X
And tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Uggh!
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his heaad?

I think I heard a shot (x5)
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

Black Nationalism
He may be a brave contender for this position
Should he abandon his supposed obedience to the
white liberal doctrine of non-violence
And embrace black nationalism
Through counter intellence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
trouble-makers and neutralize them x2
And neutralize them x6
WAKE UP x8

Hey!
How long, not long
Cause what you reap
Is what you sow!
