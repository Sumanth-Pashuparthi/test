By popular demand you fall to waste again.
Brought to the execution by a friend.
The guilt is wearing down the defense, and gearing up your same old reasons.
Allowing you to relive the same old day.

I can see the pain living inside you.
I can see the change standing beside you.
Lean on me this time.

Somehow you slip behind and go on your way.
Somewhere inside you'll find a place to make this stay.
For now it's wearing down the defense, deconstructing every pretense.
Crawling up your spine and watching you decay.

[Chorus]
