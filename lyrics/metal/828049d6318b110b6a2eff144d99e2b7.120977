Highest High
Deep inside
Lifts you up, sets you free like nothing else can.

Highest High,
Highest High,
Takes you there, brings you back again

Big dreams never sleep, no
I made a promise to myself I've got to keep, I...
I was down for something,
always looking outside for the one thing I could feel.

But when my faith was under fire,
I never turned around
and never once backed down
from my desire
my heart and soul
still had control
and I knew I...

I had the highest high
that power deep inside
that lifts you up, and sets you free like nothing else can.
Highest High
Love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again.

Ever since that day, yeah
I know I'll never feel alone or be afraid, I...
I was on a mission,
on a search for fear,
trying to find the reason for the trouble that I've been.

But when my faith was under fire,
I never turned around
and never once backed down
from my desire
my heart and soul
still had control
and I knew I...

I had the highest high
that power deep inside
that lifts you up, and sets you free like nothing else can.
I got the highest High
Love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again.

I got the highest high
that power deep inside
that lifts you up, and sets you free like nothing else can.
I got the highest High
Love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again.

I'm high I'm so high
Feet don't touch the ground
head's up in the clouds
I'm high I'm so high
Feet don't touch the ground
head's up in the clouds

I was down for something,
that so for real
always looking outside for the one thing I could feel.
and when my faith was under fire, fire...
I never turned round, and...
I never backed down, yeah...
