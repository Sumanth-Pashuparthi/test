Verse 1:

It's packed niggas don't know how to act

with a stack of numbers
my niggas like 'em dumber
we oughta get 'em smarter
Baby take my order
The only shark that swim in Henn no water
got ya daughter doin' shit you don't think she oughta
Gave the order to slaughter any ass like that
you know how the loni act off the cognac
Brainiac with maniac Mack 10 (my nigga)

Nigga back in so we can smoke a dub
down ta bump all these bitches at the club (Yaeeyaae)
show me love &lt;chorus starts over this line&gt;

Chorus:

We be clubbin'
everybody likes when the girl

Nigga don't pull nothing (That's right)
We ain't dumping

Ah, we be clubbin'(we be clubbin')

(Y'all in fo the night?)
Hell no
Security bail slow up in the club

it's only love
Dubs for everybody waitin' on us
and fuck everybody hatin' on us
debatin' on us but we only visitin'
ain't tryin' ta fuck with niggas in lizard skins
I see you watching me, you should watch her
'cause if she sick of yo' shit I'm the doctor watch her
Show her to the car
&amp; see how bad she wanna meet these stars
They know who we are (Where we going?) WESTSIDE
Nigga meet me by the bar

Bridge:

Shake it off shake it off take it off
break it off break it off make it soft (4X)
Brrr (we be clubbin') uhh (uhh) (we be clubbin' 2X)

Verse 3:

Baby beware Ice Cube is on tilt
waitress bitchin' off the drinks my nigga spilt
Everybody's sweatin' like it's Armageddon
1999 party over oops I'ma still grind
Straight from the West put away yo' 9 (click click)
DJ can ya play my shit one mo' time
Goddamn you fine (my nigga speak on it)
she got ass for days (put a week on it)
Now everybody in the world love to go clubbin'
and after the club it's either breakfast or fuckin'
Hope we ain't duckin' from haters in the parking lot
who ain't got nothin' tryin' to prove sumthin
Frontin' we be the niggas who be bluntin'
on our way to the Marriott keep 'em very hot
Westside hittin' hairy cock all night long
Get ya club on!

Chorus
