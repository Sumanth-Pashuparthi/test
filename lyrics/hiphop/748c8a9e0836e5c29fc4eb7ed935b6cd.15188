I thought it was over, baby.
We said our goodbyes.
But I can't go a day without your face going through my mind.
In fact, not a single minute
passes without you in it.
Your voice, your touch.
Memories of your love are with me all of the time.

Let me let go, baby.
Let me let go.
If this is for the best why are you still in my heart,
are you still in my soul?
Let me let go.

I talked to you the other day,
oh looks like you made your escape.
You put us behind;
no matter how I try, I can't do the same.

Let me let go, baby won't you
Let me let go.
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles
down a dead-end road.

Let me let go

The lights of this strange city are shining,
but they don't hold no fascination for me.
I try to find the bright side baby,
but everywhere I look,
everywhere I turn,
you're all I see.

Let me...
Let me let go, baby won't you
Let me let go.
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles
down a dead-end road.

Oh let me let go, darlin', won't you?
I just gotta know
if this is for the best why are you still in my heart,
you're still in my soul
Let me let go, why don't you
Let me let go
Let me let go.
