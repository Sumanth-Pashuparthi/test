Please make this heart of mine
Synchronize your beat
Only your words will I speak
To feel your love and mercy
Shine on through me
To make me feel complete

Take all of me
I'm falling on my knees
So I can see

I have made my choice to follow
I'll worship you alone forever

Let your rain fall down on me
Feel the warmth of your embrace
To know that this is grace
May I forever sing your praise
Give glory to your name
I'll love you all my days

Take all of me
I'm falling on my knees
So I can see

I have made my choice to follow
I'll worship you alone forever

I'm calling on you now
With open arms I pray that I'll be found
To know your love's abound
Your grace and mercy finds me even now

I have made my choice to follow
I'll worship you alone forever

Forever, forever, forever
