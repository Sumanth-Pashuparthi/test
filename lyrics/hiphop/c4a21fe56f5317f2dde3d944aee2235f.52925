In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers object of hate
Who's the one some think is great
I'm that one, son of a gun
Drivin' by, wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun, never on the run
They know not to come cause they all get some
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain
Out the window, middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers got the nerve and gall
To talk 'bout my car when they're walkin' tall
Pullin' away, every day
Leavin' you in the dust
So you know I get paid, on the mile ego trip
And 5-o tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
This episode always is the same
Seein' no comp comin' like I'm blind
All left back, tailin' my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let go, my turbo
Run, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow
Laughin' hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charged me contempt
I'd rub my boomerang, feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud

Cruisin' down the boulevard
treated like a superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car
All you suckers in the other ride
When I'm comin' get to the side
My 98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail, better watch my face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows, super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My 98-O blows 'em all away
Understand, I don't drive drunk
My 98's fly, I don't drive no junk
No cop gotta a right to call me a punk
Take his ticket, go to hell and stick it
Pull me on a kick but, line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't even know what happenin', what's up
Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckered wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Step outside, got in my ride
Drove them around, looked around town
Caught I'm out there cold, ran I'm over and down
They didn't get me, that's the truth
Cause my 98-O is bullet proof
