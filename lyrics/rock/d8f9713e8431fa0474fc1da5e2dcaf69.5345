Now everybody, have you heard, if you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm, Don't take no style
Gotta thirst for killin', Grab your vial and

Put your right hand out, give a firm handshake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your Ear Pollution, both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and

Stroke Me, Stroke Me
Could be a winner boy you move mighty well
Stroke Me, Stroke Me, (Stroke), Stroke Me, Stroke Me
You got your number down, Stroke Me, Stroke Me
Say you're a winner but man, you're just a sinner now
Put your left foot out, keep it all in place
Work your way, right into my face
First you try to bet me, you make my backbone slide
When you find you've bend me, slip on by, and

Stroke Me, Stroke Me
Give me the reason this is all night long
Stroke Me, Stroke Me, (Stroke), Stroke Me, Stroke Me
Get yourself together boy, Stroke Me, Stroke Me
Say you're a winner but man, you're just a sinner now
(Stroke, Stroke, Stroke, Stroke, Stroke, Stroke, Stroke)
Put your left foot out, keep it all in place
Work your way right into my face
First you try to bet me, you make my backbone slide
When you find you've bled me, slip on by, and

Stroke, stroke stroke stroke
Better listen now, said it ain't no joke
Don't let your conscience fail ya' just do the stroke
Don't ya' take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just ...
Stroke me, stroke me
