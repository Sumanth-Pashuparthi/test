Two dreamers
What would it feel like to meet by light of day
So lonely
Wouldn't if feel right to love this night away?
Your name keeps echoing down this wishing well
Wild hearts on an endless flight
Set free in our dreams tonight

Chorus:
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes
One girl lost in a reverie
Lost love found in a memory
Those nights live on forever
Two fools lost in a desperate dream

Torn pages
More than a memory, pieces of the past
One vision
Your image keeps haunting me, a love too good to last
Your voice keeps echoing down this wishing well
Wild hearts on an endless flight
Set free our dreams tonight

(Chorus)

One love divided
Burns brightly through the night
Two dreams united
Until the morning light

(Chorus)
