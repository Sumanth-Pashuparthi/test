Two worlds collide - rival nations,
It's a primitive clash - venting years of frustrations,
Bravely we hope against all hope - there is so much at stake.
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes.
Does the crowd understand?
Is a East versus West, or man against man,
Can any nation stand - alone.

*In the burning heart - just about to burst,
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst,
In the darkest night - rising like a spire,
In the burning heart - the unmistakable fire.*

In the warriors code - there's no surrender,
Though his body says stop - his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember,
Knows it's you against you, it's the
Paradox that drives us on -
It's a battle of wills, in the heat of attack,
It's the passion that kills -
The victory is yours alone.
