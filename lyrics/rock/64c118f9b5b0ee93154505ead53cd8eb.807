Anthony works in the grocery store
Saving his pennies for someday.
Momma Leoni left a note on the door.
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country.
Working too hard can give you a heart attack, ack, ack, ack;
You oughtta know by now.
Who need a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?"
It seems such a waste of time.
If that's what it's all about...
Momma, if that's moving up, then I'm moving out.

Sergeant O'Leary is walking the beat.
At night, he becomes a bartender.
He works at Mr. Cacciatorre's down on Sullivan Street,
Across from the medical center,
And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac, lac, lac, lac;
You oughtta know by now,
If he can't drive with a broken back,
At least he can polish the fenders.
And it seems such a waste of time,
If that's what it's all about...
Momma, if that's moving up, then I'm moving out.

You should never argue with a crazy, ma, ma, man;
You oughtta know by now.
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?
And if that's what you have in mind
yeah if that's what you're all about..
Good luck moving up, cause I'm moving out.
