first i learned to crawl and then some other strokes
i can never remember any real good jokes

do you feel like swimming
do you feel like swimming
yes right now

i know a way to swim all the way down town
i know a way to swim all the way down town

it's a lot like swimming first time over your head
it gets easier when you move your arms and legs
and for air you lift your head, why don't we try right now
yes right now
yes right now
well

i know a way to swim all the way down town
i know a way to swim all the way down town well
i know a way to swim all the way down town
i know a way to swim all the way down town

we'll go by way of the garden, fat with tomatoes and leaves on the vine
sweet like the way it was
like swimming for the very first time

do you feel like swimming
do you feel like swimming
well
