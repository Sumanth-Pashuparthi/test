You don't like crazy music,
You don't like rockin'Bands
You just wanna go to a movie show,
And sit their holdin' hands
You're so square, baby I don't care

You don't like hotrod racin'
Or drivin' late at night
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark
You just wanna hold me tight
You're so square, baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that are new
But no one else could love me like you do do do do


I don't know why my heart flips, I only know it does
I only want to love you baby, I guess its just because
You're so square, baby I don't care

You don't like crazy music, you don't like rockin'Bands
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holdin' hands
You're so square, baby I don't care
Baby I don't care, baby I don't care
