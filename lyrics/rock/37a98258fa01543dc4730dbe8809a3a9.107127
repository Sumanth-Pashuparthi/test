Hanging on a curtain
Swinging like a clock
(Swinging like a clock)
Big hand on the seven
Little hand on top
(Little hand on top)

You said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
(Told me not to stop)
You said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
(Told me not to stop)

Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hand inside your clothes
Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hand inside your clothes

Cute buttons like pointy little teeth, Woh!
Don't bite please
Cute buttons like pointy little teeth, Woh!
Don't bite please

Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hand inside your clothes

Hanging on a curtain
Swinging like a clock

You told me not to stop

You said you like to hear me talk
