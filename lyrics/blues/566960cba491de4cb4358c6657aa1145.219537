I wanna tell ya 'bout a dance, that's goin' around
Everybody doin' it, from the grownups down
Don't have to move your head
Don't have to move your hands
Don't have to move your lips
Just shake your hips
And do the hip shake baby
And do the hip shake baby
Do the hip shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Now if you don't know, don't be afraid
Just listen to me, and do what I say
Don't move your head
Don't move your hands
Don't move your lips
Just shake your hips
And do the hip shake baby
And do the hip shake baby
Do the hip shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Now ain't this e-e-e-e-e-e-easy
Well I met a little girl, in a country town
She said, &quot;Whataya know..., there, Slim Harpo?&quot;
I didn't move my head
I didn't move my hands
I didn't move my lips
Just shook our hips
She did the hip shake baby
Did the hip shake baby
Did the hip shake baby
Shake your hips baby
Now ain't this e-e-e-e-e-e-easy
