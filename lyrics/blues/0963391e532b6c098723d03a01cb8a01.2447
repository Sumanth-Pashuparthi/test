Take that look of worry, I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing, so I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning right outside my door
I can't see, but I feel it, and it helps to keep me warm

So I, I don't mind,
no I, I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waiting, still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping, I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you, I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings, like they're turning off the light

But I, I don't mind,
no I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind

So take, take me home,
'cos I don't remember,
take, take me home
'Cos I don't remember,
take, take me home, oh Lord

'Cos I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can see you

Take that look of worry, mine is an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight and sleeping when it's night
I have no far horizons, I don't wish upon no star
They don't think that I listen, ah but I know who they are

But I, I don't mind,
no I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind,
no I, I don't mind

So take, take me home,
'Cos I don't remember, take, take me home
'Cos I don't remember, take, take me home
'Cos I don't remember, take, take me home, oh Lord

Well I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can see you

But I don't remember - take, take me home
'cos I don't remember - take, take me home (repeats)
