You win
Its your show, now
so whats it gunna be
cause people
will tune in
how many train wrecks do we need to see?
before we lose touch of
we thought this was low
It's bad gettin worse ah

Chorus:
Whered all the good people go
Ive been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that and
with a rattle a tat
testing one two,
now whatcha gunna do?
bad news, misused,
got too much to lose
gimme some truth
now whos side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
Im in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting round feeling far away
so far away but I can feel the debris
can you feel it?
you interrupt me from a friendly conversation
to tell me how great its all gunna be
you might notice some hesitation
Its important to you is not important to me
Way down by the edge of your reasons
its beginning to show
and all I really wanna know is..

Whered all the good people go
Ive been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one, two
Man what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused, gimme some truth
You got too much to lose
Whose side are we on?
Anyway ok, Whatever you say
Wrong or resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
Going Going Gone...
