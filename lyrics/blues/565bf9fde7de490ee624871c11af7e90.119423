I wish I had a heart of stone
I wouldn't be here crying for you babe
Wondering how to live now you're gone
How to spend the winter nights keepin' warm
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby

I wish I'd taken to my bed
All the pretty faces I could have had
But I was always true to you, my love
It broke my heart that you weren't ever never true
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby

Oh - oh baby don't leave me this way
And all my need unsatisfied
Cheri baby, baby baby
Baby, I love you, baby

I wish I could make mere music
So people all over the world dance about
But you ain't have nothing for me to laugh about
You ain't have nothing to care about
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby

It hurts to be in love with you
You don't know how much I could do
With a heart of stone, babe
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby
Cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby
Oh oh cheri babe - ch-cheri, cheri baby

Cheri, cheri baby, cheri, cheri baby
Oh oh - ch-cheri, cheri baby
It hurts to love you baby - ch-cheri, cheri baby
It hurts to love you - ch-cheri, cheri baby ....
