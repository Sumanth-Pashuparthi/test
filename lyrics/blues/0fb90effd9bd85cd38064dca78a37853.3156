It started with a kiss in the back row of a classroom.
How could I resist the aroma of your perfume.
You and I were inseparable
it was love at first sight.
You made me promise to marry you
I made you promise to be my wife

But then you were only eight years old and I had just about turned nine.
I thought that life was always good
I thought you always would be mine.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
I remember ev'ry little thing like fighting in the playground

As some good looking boy had started to hang around.
That boy hurt me so bad
but I was happy 'cause you cried. - still -
I couldn't help but notice that new distant look in your eyes

And then when you were sixteen
and I had just turned seventeen

I couldn't hold on to your love
I couldn't hold on to my dreams.

It started with a kiss
never thought is would come to tf&amp;uuml;s.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
You don't remember me
do you? You don't remember me
do you?
Walking down the street came the star of my love story

And my heart began to beat so fast
so clear was my memory.
I heard my voice cry out her name
and as she looked and looked awa
I felt so hurt
I felt so small
and it was all that I could say

You don't remember me
do you? You don't remember me
do you?
You don't remeIhber me
do you? You don't remember me
do you?
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
