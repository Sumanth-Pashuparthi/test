(Gary Moore)

You've been turnin' me upside down
since the day I met you.
But no matter how hard I try,
I can't seem to forget you.
You've been turning me inside out
since the day I found you.
So why do I spend all of my time
just hangin' around you?


I don't care what you say to me.
From the way you been behaving,
now it's plain to see.


You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
Like you broke my heart before.


Everybody tells me
that I'd be better off without you.
So why do I spend all of my time
just thinking about you?


I don't care what you say to me.
From the things that I've been hearing,
now it's plain to see.


You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
Just like you broke my heart before.


I don't care what you say to me.
From the way you been behaving,
now it's plain to see.


You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
Just like you broke my heart before.


You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
Just like you broke my heart before.


You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
You're gonna break my heart again.
