I want a sunshine everyday
Just spend my time in a stupid way
It's time to forgive the winter
Time to feel good and warm air
I want sunshine when you say
That I'm a stupid boy who runs away
It's easier when it doesn't rain to change my mind and stay
You tell me that I could be happy, that gets me nasty
I want a sunshine on my days
To clear and burn the trash I said
It's time to forgive the winter
A time to feel good and warm air
It's time for me to follow my own way and forget the trash I said
You tell me that I could be happy, that gets me nasty
I agree if you say "you're selfish", you're right, that's me
It's time to find a place to dive in sea and burn
