Doing what I love wid my best friend
And making cheddar!

Michelle
(Aint it funny?)
God always know whats he doing
And he showed me some of that when you came
Into me and Bees life
And just let us know that we can count on you
And actually stay with a relaxed heart
Together we are sisters
Your smile has so much meaning
So much life
You are the perfect fit
What more could we ask for?
We got Michelle!
Your voice is like water
Your voice is like rain
And the world aint ready for you
I love you and I will always be here for you!

Beyonce Weve come so far together
And it feels so good to have travelled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger
And I love you for the
Loyal, unselfish, generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one ABSOLUTLEY NO ONE can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend!
(Michelles vocals)
Bee and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldnt see
But if we pray together
Well stay together

(Michelles thanks)

Beyonce and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
Love is patient.Beyonce thats what youre been
Love is kind Miss Kelly, thatswhat youre shown
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not
self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrong. Love does
not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always
trusts, always hopes, always preserves.
1 Corinthians 13: 4-7
