What you thinkin' about?
You and me goin' one-on-one (say what)
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)
MC y'all (what you think about)
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (c'mon)
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

MC:
Boy, haven't you noticed (say what)
The gleam in my eyes (uh, huh)
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)
But everytime you're with me (uh)
Feel so positive
That with you a little love
Somethings gotta give

MC:
A full moon is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon you will come to be my light
Here we are
Hoping that we'll never part
Stay with me

But this romantic evening
You led me at my door (yeah, yeah)
But tonight, I'd like to explore

JD y'all
MC y'all
See, I saw you at the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
On what I want my wife to be (ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
And usin' wild name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest
I ever seen in a long time (uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is her own time
And I don't hit
Cuz I'm tired of dealin'
With the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bull****
She got a playa
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)
She up in the corner
Sippin' Don P, Rosee` (yeah)
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything you see in your dreams
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart
