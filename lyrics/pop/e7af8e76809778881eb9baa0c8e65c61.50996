I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey hey,(uh uh uh) this is what I say (yeah yeah)

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no the reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, Babe
I can't get no (I can't get no satisfaction)

When I'm watchin' my TV (uh uh)
And that girl comes on and tells me
How tight my skirt should be
But she can't tell me who to be, Babe
I've got my own identity (uh)
I can't get no, oh no no no
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no sat-tis-fac-tion

And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I just can't get no

I can't get no (oh yeah yeah yeah) satisfaction (no no no)

I can't get no (I cant get no) satisfaction
oooohhhh
I cant get no (no baby)satisfaction
(oh this is what i say)
I cant get no(I cant get no) satisfaction
I cant get no (oh baby)satisfaction
I cant get no satisfaction
I cant get no satisfaction
no matter what i do no matter what i say
everywhere i go they say it's not okay
no matter what i do no matter what i say
everywhere i go they say it's not okay
Oh baby
i cant get no satisfaction
i cant get no satisfaction
SPOKEN: I cant get no satisfaction baby
