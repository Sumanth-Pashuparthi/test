He walks in the club with love in his eyes
Sexy steps flock flockin females by his side
Lookin scrumptious, even though he ain't tryin'
Finest thing that you ever did see
sexy creation had his hat tilted to the side
Starin at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualize, had my body paralyzed
as he smiled at me, I said
Hey boy would you enjoy sittin' next to me in your corduroys?
I'm from Texas my girl is from Illinois
Where you from, can I come visit you sometimes?
My oh my you seem like husband material
That and a cheerio
Are you married cause your very very extraordinary, kinda scary
I want your name added to my vocabulary

*Chorus* 2x
Lullaby love
Where have you been all of my life?
Your chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

Tell me your dreams and aspirations
What's your furture plans
What's your motivations
Boy I'm lovin how your so unpredictible, boy I'm feelin you
Guess I gotta get with you
Admiring your Marc Jacob gear
Hit as I step say a prayer
you available, so sensual
lullaby love heartbreakable, so special, baby makeable

*Chorus*


It's all in the way you look at me
Apple Pie A La Mode
I'm sure I'll me enjoying your company
Apple Pie A La Mode
you turning me on with your modesty
Apple Pie A La Mode
You have such a beautiful personality
Apple Pie A La Mode
HEEEEE

*Chorus*

Beyonce
So scrumptious love
Apple a la pie mode
