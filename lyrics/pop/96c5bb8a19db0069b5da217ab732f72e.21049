Among the many muted faces
You try to find me in the spaces
You're drawn to my song (oh)
You only move to
Keep from sinking
You close your eyes
As if you're thinking
Afraid all along
That in my eyes
You're revealing
You'll find out
What you're needing

Nothing but pennies
In my pocket
Nothing but faith
To keep me warm
Well baby,
Wouldn't I be broke without it
Tell me, how much
For your love?
Slip my heart in
Your back pocket
All that I got to
Keep me warm
So baby
Don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much
For your love?

(How much for your love?)

Hoping the melody
Will leave you
You walked here where
I might not see you
Reach out to the wind
(Reach out to the wind)
Looking to catch it for a minute
But just to hold it, not be in it
I've been where you've been
'Cause somehow I'm so afraid
The love will reveal
How much you're made of

Nothing but pennies
In my pocket
Nothing but faith to
Keep me warm
Well baby
Wouldn't I be broke without it
Tell me, how much
For your love?
Slip my heart in
Your back pocket
All that I got to
Keep me warm
So baby
Don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much
For your love?
How much for your love?

Nothing but pennies
In my pocket
Nothing but faith to
Keep me warm
Well baby
Wouldn't I be without it
Tell me, how much
For your love?
Slip my heart in
Your back pocket
All that I got to
Keep me warm
So baby
Don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much
For your love?

Your love, yeah yeah yeah
Your love
Nothing but
Nothing but, oh yeah

Nothing but pennies
In my pocket
Nothing but faith to
Keep me warm
Well baby,
Wouldn't I be broke without it
Tell me, how much
For your love?
Slip my heart in
Your back pocket
All that I got to
Keep me warm
So baby
Don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much
For your love?

Nothing but pennies
In my pocket
Nothing but faith to
Keep me warm
Well baby,
I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much
For your love?
Slip my heart in
Your back pocket
All that I got to
Keep me warm
So baby
Don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much
For your love?
