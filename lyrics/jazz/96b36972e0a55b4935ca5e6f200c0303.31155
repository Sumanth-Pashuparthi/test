Takin' my time, choosin' my lines
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop, don't wanna get off
Got myself hung up on you
Seems to me you don't wanna talk about it
Seems to me you just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known things that I'm growin'
Don't taste the same without you
I got myself in the worst mess I've been
And I find myself starving without you
Seems to me talk all night here comes the morning
Seems to me you just forget what we said and greet the day

I've got to cool myself down stompin' around
Thinkin' some words I can't name ya
Meet ya halfway got nothin' to say
Still I don't s'pose I can blame ya
Seems to me you don't wanna talk about it
Seems to me you just turn your pretty head
Walk Away
