I've got a girl and Ruby is her name
she don't love me but I love her just the same

Ruby Ruby, how I want you
like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you
Ruby Ruby, when will you be mine?

Each time I see my baby, my heart cries
I'm gonna steal her away from all those guys

From the sunny day I met you
made a bet that I would get you
Ruby Ruby, when will you be mine?
