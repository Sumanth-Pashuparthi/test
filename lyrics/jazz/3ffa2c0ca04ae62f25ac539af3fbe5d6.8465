You thought you had found a good girl,
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you been misused,
Talk to me, I'll do what you choose.

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right

The girl you had didn't have no sense,
She wasn't worth all the time you spent


She had another man throw you outdoors,
Now the same man is wearing your clothes.

She would embarrass you anywhere,
She let everybody know she didn't care
Give me a chance I been begging you
I just want to take care of you.

Tell your Mama, what you want, tell your Mama, what you need
Tell your Mama, what you got to have
