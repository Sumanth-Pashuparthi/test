Put the candle in the window
Cause I feel I've gotta move
Though I'm going, going
I'll be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
Pack my bags and lets get moving
Cause I'm bound to drift awhile
Though I'm gone, I'm gone
You don't have to worry about me
Long as I can see the light
Guess I've got that old travellin' bone
But I feel I'm leavin' alone
But I won't, I won't be losing my way
No, long as I can see the light
Won't you play that thing for me now

Put a candle in the window
Cause I feel I've gotta move
Cause I'm going, going
I'll be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
