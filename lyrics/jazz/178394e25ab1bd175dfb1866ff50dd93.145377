Ladies and gentlemen, most people record songs about love, heartbreak, loneliness, being broke... Nobody's actually went out and recorded a song about real pain. The band and I have just returned from the General Hospital where we caught a man in the right position. We name this song: &quot;Constipation Blues&quot;.
