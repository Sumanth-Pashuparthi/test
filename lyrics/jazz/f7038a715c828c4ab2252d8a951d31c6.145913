I got ideas but I don't know it all
And when I speak you know my voice is small
And when I'm walking down the street
I never smile at folks I meet
Cause I know they won't smile at me
Now ask yourself why this should be

But if you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me
If you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me

I got feelings but they don't count for much
And I shake my fist but I got no power as such
But if I tell you what I see
Don't throw my words right back at me
Cause I can't shout and I can't moan
Cause I got problems of my own

But if you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me
If you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me

Someday soon I gotta learn enough
To justify my actions
Until then I want you all to try
To share my gut reactions
Gut reactions

But if you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me
If you want the answers
If you want the answers
Don't ask me
