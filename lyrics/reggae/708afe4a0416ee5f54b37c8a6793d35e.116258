I'm going pissed to church and sing
The Russian National Hymne,
I like to fart in libraries
and I do it with a grin,
I fuck fuck fuck my best friends girl
and tell him she's a slut,
and in a crowded aeroplane
I love to use a bag.

I'm mean, I'm bad, I lie to you,
I never tell the truth,
set fire to your bed at night and shit into your boots.
So if you ever should think for yourself
how nice it would be, oh so nice,
rip up your sisters teddybear.
STAY RUDE!,
that's my advice.

Selling dope to teenage kids is the biggest fun,
the money I get out of it,
enough to buy a gun.
I steal old ladies handbags and
I drink your last beer,
I nick my boss's Jaguar and sell it much to dear.

I'm mean, I'm bad, I lie to you,
I never tell the truth,
set fire to your bed at night and shit into your boots.
So if you ever should think for yourself
how nice it would be, oh so nice,
rip up your sisters teddybear.
STAY RUDE!,
that's my advice.
