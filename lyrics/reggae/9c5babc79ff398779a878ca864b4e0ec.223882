The Ten Commandments from man given to woman
Through the inspiration of I, Prince Buster

One, thou shall have no other man but me

Two, thou shall not encourage no man to make love to you
Neither kiss nor caress you
For I am your man, a very jealous man
And is ready to lay low any other man that may intrude in our love

Three, remember to kiss and caress me
Honor and obey me, in my every whim and fancy
Seven days a week and twice on Sundays
Because at no time will I ever be tired of I-T, it
Honor my name so that every other woman may honor it also

Five, thou shall not provoke me to anger
Or my wrath will descend upon you heavily

Commandment Six, thou shall not search my pockets at night
Or annoy me with your hearsays

Commandment Seven, thou shall not shout my name in the streets
If I'm walking with another woman
But wait intelligently until I come home
Then we both can have it out decently
For I am your man, a funny man
And detest a scandal in public places

Commandment Eight, thou shall not drink, nor smoke
Nor use profane language
For those bad habits I will not stand for

Nine, thou shall not committ adultery
For the world will not hold me guilty if I commit
Murder

Ten, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress
Nor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat
Nor anything that's hers
Neither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale
In any stores, for I will not give thee anything but what
You actually need for your purpose

Those are the Ten Commandments given from man to woman
By me, Prince Buster
