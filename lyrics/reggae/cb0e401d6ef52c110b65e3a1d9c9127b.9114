Easy skanking, skanking it easy
Easy skanking, skanking it slow (repeat)

Excuse me while I light my spliff
Oh GOD I gotta take a lift
From reality I just can't drift
That's why I am staying with this riff

Take it easy, easy skanking (repeat)
Got to take it easy, easy skanking
You see we're taking it easy
We're taking it slow, taking it easy
Got to take it slow, so take it easy
Easy skanking, easy skanking
Oh take it easy, easy skanking

Excuse me while I light my spliff
Oh GOD I gotta take a lift
From reality I just can't drift
That's why I am staying with this riff

Take it easy, taking it easy
Got to take it easy, taking it slow
Take it easy, taking it easy
Skanky taie it easy, taking it slow

Tell you what herb for my wine
Honey for my strong drink
Herb for my wine, honey for my strong drink

I'll take it easy, taking it easy
Take it easy, skanking it slow
Take it easy, taking it easy
Take it easy, skanking it slow
