Sun is shining, the weather is sweet, yeah!
Make you wanna move your dancing feet now
To the rescue, here I am!
Want you to know, y'all
Can you understand?

When the morning gather the rainbow, yeah, yeah
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too now
To the rescue, here I am!
Want you to know, y'all, can ya - can ya
Can ya understand?

Sun is shining, weather is sweet now
Make you wanna move your dancing feet, yeah
But to the rescue, here I am!
Want you to know just if you can
Here I stand!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Can you understand me now, baby?
Do you believe me?
