She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometime shifting coke
She'll be laughing when there ain't no joke

A pimper's paradise, that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was
Every need got an ego to feed
Every need got an ego to feed

She loves to model, up in the latest fashion
She's in the scramble and she moves with passion
She's getting high, trying to fly the sky
Now she is bluesing when there ain't no blues

A pimper's paradise, that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was
Every need got an ego to feed
Every need got an ego to feed

A pimper's paradise, that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise, that's all she was
A pimper's paradise, I'm sorry for the victim now
A pimper's paradise, soon their heads, soon their
Soon their very heads will bow
Pimper's paradise, don't lose track
Don't lose track of yourself, oh no!
Pimper's paradise, don't be just a stock
A stock on the shelf, stock on the shelf
Pimper's paradise, that's all she was
