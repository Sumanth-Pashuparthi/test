Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, Israelite, sah

Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that a-every mouth can be fed
(Poor) poor me, Israelite

My wife and my kids, they are packed up and leave me
Darling, she said, I was yours to be seen
(Poor) poor me, Israelite

Shirt them a-tear up, trousers are gone
I don't want to end up like Bonnie and Clyde
(Poor) poor me, Israelite

After a storm there must be a calming
They catch me in the farm, you sound your alarm
(Poor) a poor, a poor, a poor me, Israelite, eeee

I said I get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
(Poor) poor me, Israelite, sir

I said my wife and my kids, they are packed up and leave me
Darling, she said, I was yours to be seen
(Poor) poor me, Israelite, sir

Look, shirt them a-tear up, trousers are gone
I don't want to end up like Bonnie and Clyde
(Poor) a poor, a poor, Israelite, sir

After a storm there must be a calming
They catch me in the farm, you sound your alarm
(Poor) poor me, Israelite, yeeee

(Poor) a poor, a poor, a poor me, Israelite
Uh, I wonder who I'm working for

(Poor) a poor, a poor, a poor me, Israelite
I look a-down and out, sir
(Poor) a poor, a poor, a poor me, Israelite
