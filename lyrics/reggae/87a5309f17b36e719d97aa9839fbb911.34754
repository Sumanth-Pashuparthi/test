Marcus Garvey's words come to pass,-
Marcus Garvey's words come to pass,

Can't get no food to eat,
Can't get no money to spend, Wo-oo-oo
Can't get no food to eat,
Can't get no money to spend, Woo -oo- oo

Come, little one and let me do what I can do for you
And you and you alone
Come, little one, wo-oo-oo
Let me do what I can do for you and you alone, woo-oo-oo

He who knows the right thing
And do it not
Shall be spanked with many stripes,

Weeping and wailing and moaning,
You've got yourself to blame, I tell you.
Do right do right do right do right do right,
Tell you to do right, Woo -oo- oo
Beg you to do right, Woo -oo- oo

Where is Bagawire, he's nowhere to be found
He can't be found
First betrayer who gave away Marcus Garvey
Son of Satan, First prophesy,
Catch them, Garvey old
Catch them Garvey, catch them Woo -oo- oo
Hold them Marcus, hold them Woo -oo- oo
Marcus Garvey, Marcus Woo -oo- oo
