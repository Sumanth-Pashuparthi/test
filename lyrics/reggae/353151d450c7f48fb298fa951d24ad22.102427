Madness, madness
They call it madness
Madness, madness
They call it madness
It is plain to see
That is what they mean to me
Madness, madness
I call it gladness

Madness, madness
They call it madness
Madness, madness
They call it madness
I'm about to explain
That someone is losing his brain
Madness, madness
They call it gladness

Propaganda ministers
Propaganda ministers
I've got a heavy due
I'm gonna walk all over you
'Cause

Madness, madness
I call it gladness
Well if this is madness
Man I know I'm filled with gladness
It's gonna be rougher
It's gonna be tougher
And I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
Oh no, I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
You are gonna be the one who's gonna suffer
