At first I was afraid,
I was petrified,
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side,
but then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
and I grew strong,
and I learned how to get along!

And so you're back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
if I had known for just one second,
you'd be back to bother me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself,
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high,
and you see me,
somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like dropping in,
and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive,
I will survive,
I will survive!
