Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space,
and the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
all your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
bringing life to THE kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
all your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
we all, will live LOVE forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
loving life, a new decree,
bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
we then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search OF you,
many lives has brought you to
recognize it's your life, now in review
and as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
a glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way
