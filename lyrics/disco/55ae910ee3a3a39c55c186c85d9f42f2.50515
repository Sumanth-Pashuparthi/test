Ooh, yeah

Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)

Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking 'bout a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live

And I know it's you (Ooh) I wanna see (Ooh) tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket (Ooh) at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(So your show can make me feel good again)

Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)

Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)

I can give you rave reviews
'Cause you sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience

And I know it's you I wanna see (Ooh) tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket (Ooh, ooh) at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(If your performance make me feel good again)

Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)

Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (Your) so good (Good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)

Can't get enough, ooh
Of your gentle lovin' touch
I can't get enough
So intense, it drives me nuts

Makes me wanna break it down now

Yeah
Mmm...
Feels so good, feels so good
It deserves an encore

Ooh, ah
