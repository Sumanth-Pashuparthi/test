Contempt in your eyes
As I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie
All my feelings denied
Blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?

You in your false securities
Tear up my life
Condemning me
Name me an illness
Call me a sin
Never feel guilty
Never give in

Tell me why?

You and me together
Fighting for our love

Can you tell me why
