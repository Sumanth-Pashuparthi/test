It takes a lifetime to become the best that we can be
We have not the time or the right to judge each other
It's one life and there's no return and no deposit - one life!
So make sure you like what's in your closet

I am what I am
I don't want praise I don't want pity
I bang my own drum
Some think it's noise, I think it's pretty
And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle
Why not try to see things from a different angle
Your life is a sham
Till you can shout out
I am what I am

I am what I am
and what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces
It's one life that I want to have a little pride in
My life, and it's not a place I have to hide in
Your life's worth a damn
Till you can shout out
I am what I am
I am what I am
I am what I am
