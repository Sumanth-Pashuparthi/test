I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever I can.
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight. It's never too soon
To want to please you,
To want to keep you
To want to do it all, all for you
I want to be your, be your rubber ball.
I want to be the boy you love most of all.
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
Turn me on!
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
I'll do what you want.
I'm your boogie man, that's what I am.
I'm here to do whatever i can.
Be it early morning, late afternoon.
Or at midnight. it's never too soon
To want to take you, to want to hold you.
I want to give my all, all to you.
And I want you to completely understand.
Wherever I'm at, wherever I am,
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
Turn me on!
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man.
I'll do what you want.
