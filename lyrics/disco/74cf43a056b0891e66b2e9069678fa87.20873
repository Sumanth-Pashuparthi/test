Went to a party the other night.
All the ladies were treating me right.
Moving my feet to the disco beat.
How in the world could I keep my seat?

All of a sudden I began to change!
I was on the dance floor acting strange!
Flapping my arms I began to cluck,
Look at me... I'm the disco duck!

Ah, get down mama, I've got to have me a woman, ha ha ha ha ha

Disco, disco duck! Got to have me a woman
Disco, disco duck! Oh get down mama
Try your luck, don't be a cluck,
Disco Disco Disco Disco
Disco Disco Disco, disco duck!
All right! Disco disco duck!
Ah, get down mama, oh mama shake your tail feather, ha ha ha ha ha

When the music stopped, I returned to my seat
But there's no stoppin' a duck and his beat!
So I got back up to try my luck.
Why look - Everybody's doin' the

Disco, disco duck!
Disco, disco duck!
Try your luck, Wave to me
Don't be a cluck! I'm so happy to be here
Disco! (Thank you duck,)
Disco! (For gettin' down.)
Disco disco disco! (Thank you so very much!)
Disco duck!
You're welcome!
Disco Disco Duck!

Try your luck, don't be a cluck, disco, disco, disco...
