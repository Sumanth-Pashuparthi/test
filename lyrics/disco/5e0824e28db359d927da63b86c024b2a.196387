DANCE WITH ME
Peter Brown featuring Betty Wright

You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high

If you're feeling sad and blue
Come on 'n dance with me
I can make your dreams come true
Come on 'n dance with me
Ladies get up off your seats
Come on 'n dance with me
Gentlemen get on your feet
Come on 'n dance with me
Say the word and I'll summon the band
With my hand
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me

You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high

If you feel that you like what you see
Dance with me

You gotta keep dancin'
Cause it's makin' me high
You gotta keep, keep dancin'
You gotta keep dancin'
Cause it's makin' me high
You gotta keep, keep dancin'
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high

You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
If you're feeling sad and blue
Come on 'n dance with me
I can make your dreams come true
Come on 'n dance with me
Say the word and I'll summon the band
With my hand
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me

You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me
