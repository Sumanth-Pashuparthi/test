Let the spirit flow all through your body
Just lend us an ear
Involve yourself
You're free to follow
And we'll take you there
You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
Just say you will
Just do what you feel
I'm for real
The music's full of joy and laughter
And it's such a thrill
To free your mind from all the pressure
Head on up the hill

[repeat chorus]
