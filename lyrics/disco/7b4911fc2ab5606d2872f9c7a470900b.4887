Hands up, baby, hands up,
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme your heart
Give it, give it.
Hands up, baby, hands up,
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme
All your love, all your love.

Angel face, I love your smile,
Love your ways, I like your style.
What can I do to get closer to you?
Don't think twice or count to ten.
Don't take advise, don't ask me when.
Just come my way, simply kiss me and say:

Hands up, baby, hands up, ...

With you head up in the sky,
Every day you're walking by,
Why don't you ever starts looking at me?
Stop that game, don't waste your time,
For all your dreams are matchin' mine,
No use to play hide and seek for a week.

Hands up, baby, hands up, ...

Let me be your Romeo, your wonder boy,
And your super champ.
Let me take you to the milky way
On a holiday, on a holiday.
Follow me (follow me) why don't you follow me (why don't you follow me)?
Just come my way simply kiss me and say:

Hands up, baby, hands up,
