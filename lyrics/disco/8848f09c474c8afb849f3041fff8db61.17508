I'm on my second drink
But I've had a few before
I'm trying hard to think
And I think that I want you on the floor
uh-huh, yeah on the floor

Go on and take it off (Take it off)
You got to shake it off baby for me
Come on and break me off (Break me off)
Cause I get what I want and I like what I see

Need your love, one, two, three
Stop starin at my d-cup
Don't waste time just give it to me
C'mon baby just feel me up
C'mon, just give it up

Go on and take it off (Take it off)
You got to shake it off baby for me
Yome on and break me off (Break me off)
Yause I get what I want and I like what I see

Forget the application
You're the right guy for the task
And let me take you on vacation
Just do it, you don't have to ask

Go on and take it off (Take it off)
You got to shake it off baby for me
Come on and break me off (Break me off)
Cause I get what I want and I like what I see

Take it off
Take it off baby for me
Take it off
Take it off baby for me
