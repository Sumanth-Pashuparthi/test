Laura and Tommy were lovers
He wanted to give her everything
Flowers, presents
But most of all
A wedding ring

He saw a sign for a stock car race
A thousand dollar prize it read
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
So to her mother, Tommy said

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do
That cannot wait

He drove his car to the racing grounds
He was the youngest driver there
The crowd roared as they started the race
Around the track they drove at a deadly pace

No one knows what happened that day
How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath
They heard him say

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

Now in the chapel where Laura prays
For her poor Tommy, who passed away
It was just for Laura he lived and died
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I love her
