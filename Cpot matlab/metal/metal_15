When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
A Rainbow in the Dark

Do your demons
Do they ever let you go
When you've tried do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
Just an image caught in time
We're a lie you and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark

(Lead/Instrumental)

When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling you beware
Look Out!

There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sight of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow
Like a Rainbow in the Dark Yeah . . .
You're a Rainbow in the Da a a a a ark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
No sign of the morning
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
